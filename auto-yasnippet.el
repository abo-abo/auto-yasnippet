;;; Commentary:

;; Setup:
;;
;; 1. Download yasnippet from https://github.com/capitaomorte/yasnippet
;;    and set it up.
;;
;; 2. Put this file into your elisp folder.
;;
;; 3. In your .emacs file:
;;     (require 'auto-yasnippet)
;;     (global-set-key (kbd "H-w") 'aya-create)
;;     (global-set-key (kbd "H-y") 'aya-expand)

;; Usage:
;; e.g. in JavaScript write:
;;
;; field~1 = document.getElementById("field~1");
;;
;; Since this just one line,
;; just call `aya-create' (from anywhere on this line).
;; The ~ chars disappear, yielding valid code.
;; `aya-current' becomes:
;; "field$1 = document.getElementById(\"field$1\");"
;; Now by calling `aya-expand' multiple times, you get:
;;
;; field1 = document.getElementById("field1");
;; field2 = document.getElementById("field2");
;; field3 = document.getElementById("field3");
;; fieldFinal = document.getElementById("fieldFinal");
;;
;; e.g. in Java write:
;;
;; class Light~On implements Runnable {
;;   public Light~On() {}
;;   public void run() {
;;     System.out.println("Turning ~on lights");
;;     light = ~true;
;;   }
;; }
;;
;; This differs from the code that you wanted to write only by 4 ~ chars.
;; Since it's more than one line, select the region and call `aya-create'.
;; Again, the ~ chars disappear, yielding valid code.
;; `aya-current' becomes:
;; "class Light$1 implements Runnable {
;;   public Light$1() {}
;;   public void run() {
;;     System.out.println(\"Turning $2 lights\");
;;     light = $3;
;;   }
;; }"
;;
;; Now by calling `aya-expand', you can quickly fill in:
;; class LightOff implements Runnable {
;;   public LightOff() {}
;;   public void run() {
;;     System.out.println("Turning off lights");
;;     light = false;
;;   }
;; }
;;
;; e.g. in C++ write:
;; const Point<3> curl(grad[~2][~1] - grad[~1][~2],
;;
;; select the region between the paren and the comma and call `aya-create'.
;;
;; You can easily obtain the final code:

;; const Point<3> curl(grad[2][1] - grad[1][2],
;;                     grad[0][2] - grad[2][0],
;;                     grad[1][0] - grad[0][1]);
;;
;; Note how annoying it would be to triple check that the indices match.
;; Now you just have to check for one line.
